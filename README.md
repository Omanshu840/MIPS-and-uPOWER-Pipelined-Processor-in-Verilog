This Assignment is breifly divided in MIPS and UPower.


Each of them contains the following main files:-

1. The Main file is the Pipeline.v which contains all the different stages in the pipeline structure.

2. To run the file you  need to compile the testbench.v file and then run the newly created a.out file.

3. The ALU32 and ALU64 are used for MIPS and UPower respectively.

4. The MainControlUnit.v contains all the respective control signals for each hardware.

5. Each mux is named respective to the stage they are used for.
